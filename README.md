# Simple Interest Calculator

## Description
This project explains how to calculate Simple Interest using a basic formula.

## Formula
Simple Interest (SI) is calculated using:
SI = (P × R × T) / 100

Where:
- P = Principal amount
- R = Rate of interest
- T = Time (in years)

## Example
If P = 1000, R = 5, T = 2  
SI = (1000 × 5 × 2) / 100 = 100
